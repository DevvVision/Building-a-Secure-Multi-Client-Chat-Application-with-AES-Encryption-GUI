# üí¨Building a Secure Multi-Client Chat Application with AES Encryption & GUI üë©‚Äçüíª

A secure, real-time multi-client chatroom application built using Python, Socket Programming, and AES encryption. This project allows multiple users to communicate securely over the network, with AES encryption ensuring that messages are transmitted privately. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built using PyQt5.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Client Socket Model**: Supports communication between multiple clients simultaneously.
- **AES Encryption**: All messages are encrypted using AES encryption, ensuring secure and private communication.
- **PyQt5 GUI**: A modern and intuitive graphical interface built using PyQt5 for seamless user experience.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Messages are delivered in real-time without delay.
- **Socket Programming**: Core functionality built using socket programming to establish client-server communication.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Socket Programming**
- **AES Encryption** (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **PyQt5** (for GUI development)
- **Threading** (for handling multiple clients concurrently)
